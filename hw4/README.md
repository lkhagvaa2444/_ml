# ðŸ§  7-Segment Display Digit Recognition using MLP (Numerical Gradient)
## This project implements a basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy to learn the mapping between 7-segment display patterns and digits 0â€“9. The network is trained using numerical gradient descent for educational purposes.
